##  Install TensorFlow version 1.3rc2

This code requires **TensorFlow version 1.3** which at the time of writing, has not been released. You can install the release candidate (v1.3rc2) using these instructions. Choose the option that's right for you:

### 1. Install the RC using Docker

This approach is the easiest option. It works similarly on Mac, Linux, and Windows, and is recommended if you have difficulty installing the RC in a virtual environment.

* [How-to run the TensorFlow Docker image on GCP.](setup/install-docker-cloud.md)

### 2. Install the RC using pip in a Virtual Environment

This approach is recommended if you prefer the smallest download. If you experience difficulty, try the Docker option above.
