# Welcome! 

You have found an old workshop. I may someday update this with new stuff, but for now - you should head to our official repo at (github.com/tensorflow/workshops)[github.com/tensorflow/workshops] for the latest easy to use Colabs on tf.keras / tf.data / and eager execution. Hope they help!
